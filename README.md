Message from Miran 
1. There's no code page ipynb. You need to include a code page to show the codes for all the applications used in your lesson.) Do this by next week. (0611 4:30PM)
2. This page should be rearranged only for the purpose of the lesson related materials. Move the log content (your planning, meeting info) to a separate md file, and name it as "Planning.md". Also link this info file somewhere in this page.

## 👻 Our Story
### The Circle of Discovery

 In the ancient city of Baghdad, amidst the bustling streets and towering minarets, lay the fabled House of Wisdom—a haven of knowledge and scholarship that beckoned the curious and the learned alike. It was within these hallowed halls that a young scholar by the name of Idris embarked on a journey that would forever alter the course of mathematical history.

 Idris was unlike his peers; his thirst for knowledge was insatiable, and he found solace amidst the dusty scrolls and ancient manuscripts that lined the shelves of the House of Wisdom. Day after day, he pored over the writings of philosophers and mathematicians from distant lands, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos through the language of numbers.

 One fateful day, while perusing a text from the distant land of India, Idris stumbled upon a peculiar notion—an enigmatic symbol known as "śūnya," which translated to "empty" or "zero." Intrigued by the idea of a number that represented nothing yet held boundless potential in the realm of calculation, Idris resolved to delve deeper into its origins and implications.

 As he immersed himself in the study of zero, Idris uncovered its profound significance in reshaping the landscape of mathematics and astronomy. No longer was zero merely a placeholder; it was a symbol of infinite possibility—a gateway to new realms of understanding.

 With unwavering determination, Idris dedicated himself to sharing this newfound knowledge with his peers. He penned treatises and engaged in spirited discussions, tirelessly spreading the gospel of zero throughout the Islamic world. Through his efforts, zero's application in algorithms and its pivotal role in the development of algebra became widely recognized, laying the foundation for future generations to build upon.

Years turned into decades, and Idris found himself looking back on a life dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. As an old man, he marveled at the profound transformation that had stemmed from a simple circle on a page—a transformation that had forever altered the course of numerical understanding.

 Though time had weathered his body, Idris's spirit remained undaunted. For his life's work had not only illuminated the path for future scholars but had also imbued the world with the boundless potential that zero brought to the realm of mathematics. And as he gazed upon the horizon, Idris knew that his legacy would endure, a testament to the infinite possibilities that lay within the embrace of zero.
