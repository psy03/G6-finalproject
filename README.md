|Story|In ancient Baghdad, young scholar Idris discovers the concept of zero ("Å›Å«nya") in Indian manuscripts at the House of Wisdom. Fascinated by its potential, Idris studies its origins and impacts on mathematics and astronomy. He then dedicates his life to teaching others about zero, profoundly influencing mathematical thought across the Islamic world and eventually Europe. Reflecting in his later years, Idris appreciates how zero transformed scientific and numerical understanding, leaving a lasting legacy that would inspire countless future scholars.|
